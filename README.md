# RealEstate-Tenant-Retention-Optimization

## Building an Interactive Power BI Dashboard for Residential Real Estate Excellence

### Business Overview/Problem
HomeVibe Properties has identified several pressing challenges related to tenant retention:

- **High Tenant Churn Rates**: The company faces elevated tenant turnover rates, resulting in increased operational costs and lost revenue.
- **Limited Tenant Insights**: HomeVibe Properties lacks actionable insights into tenant satisfaction and their concerns, making it challenging to proactively address issues.
- **Inefficient Lease Renewals**: The lease renewal process is plagued by inefficiencies, contributing to tenant dissatisfaction and administrative overhead.
- **Lack of Trend Identification**: Identifying trends and patterns affecting tenant retention is difficult, hindering the development of effective retention strategies.

### Rationale for the Project
The importance of tenant retention in the real estate and property management industry cannot be overstated. Here are the top five reasons highlighting the significance of this project:

- **Enhanced Revenue**: Improved tenant retention directly correlates with increased revenue and profitability as existing tenants renew their leases.

- **Operational Efficiency**: Streamlining lease renewal processes reduces administrative overhead, allowing for better resource allocation.
- **Competitive Edge**: Data-driven decision-making provides a competitive advantage in the highly competitive real estate market.
- **Sustainability**: A focus on tenant retention aligns with sustainable business practices by reducing the environmental impact of turnover.

### Aim of the Project
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

- **Interactive Tenant Retention Dashboard**: Design and implement an interactive tenant retention dashboard using Power BI.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze historical tenant data to identify factors affecting tenant churn and provide actionable insights.
- **Lease Renewal Optimization**: Streamline lease renewal processes to increase tenant retention rates.
